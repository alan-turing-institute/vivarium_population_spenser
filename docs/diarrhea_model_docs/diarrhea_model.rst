Diarrhea Incidence
##################
Diarrhea is defined as three or more loose stools within a 24 hour period. A person can suffer from mild, moderate, or severe diarrhea.
A mild case of diarrhea is defined as a person that has diarrhea but does not seek treatment for said diarrhea.
A moderate case of diarrhea is defined as a person that has diarrhea and does seek treatment for said diarrhea, but no dehydration or seizures are present.
A severe case of diarrhea is defined as a person that has diarrhea and seek treatment for said diarrhea and has dehydration and seizures.
This definition will change for GBD 2016.
You may notice that there is a serious data limitation surrounding someone that has severe diarrhea, but does not seek treatment. This is a known issue that will hopefully be fixed in the next iterations of GBD.

Outstanding Questions
#####################
Seems like PAFs only apply to children under 5 in GEMs. How did we calculate PAFs for older ages?
Multiplying PAF by prevalence envelope gives prevalence of diarrhea due to a specific etiology?
