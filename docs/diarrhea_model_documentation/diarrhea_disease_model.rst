Diarrhea Disease Model Documentation
====================================

We set up a state for each diarrhea pathogen as well as a state for "unattributed" diarrhea (i.e. diarrhea that is not associated with any of the 13 pathogens in GBD). In the code, it means that our population table has 14 columns (one column for each of 13 pathogens and one column for "unattributed" diarrhea). 

Questions
*********
1. Should we use disability weight for each severity?
2. Are we applying the severity splits correctly?
