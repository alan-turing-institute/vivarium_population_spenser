def test_ors_exposure_effect():
    # might need to adapt some of the existing tests for the categorical relative risks code
    # test that those that receive ORS actually have a far lower mortality probability than those that have diarrhea but no ORS
    # need to make sure that ORS count (the ors_clock section) is properly working


# Important high-level test -- if using the GBD estimate of ORS (no artificial increase) diarrhea incidence should be the same whether or not we include ORS in the model, unless we can't calculate ORS-deleted diarrhea incidence
